<font face="Courier M" color="red" font="65">"A Dream of Death?"
BY WALT WHITMAN, 
I DREAMED that one had died in a strange place
Near no accustomed hand,
And they had nailed the boards above her face,
The peasants of that land,
Wondering to lay her in that solitude,
And raised above her mound
A cross they had made out of two bits of wood,
And planted cypress round;
And left her to the indifferent stars above
Until I carved these words:
She was more beautiful than thy first love,
But now lies under boards.

</i></font><font face="Courier M" color="orange" font="54"> I’ve lost friends and family
to the veiled imposter
cost me my sister
promised you’d look after her
dint you?<br>
I wish you’d give her back to me
it’s fucking sinister
watching you eat her alive
Drugs feel good
in the absence of connection
if I open up my arms though
will I die of suffocation?<br>
I’m barely afloat
in my sea of realisation
n if I take you in I’ll drown
before I’ve reached my destination
But I’ll see you there sister
You’ll be wild and free
floating in on t’sea breeze
you’ll reach out to me
and we’ll dance to Madonna
like we used to
